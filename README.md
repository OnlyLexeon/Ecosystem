Genetic Algorithm Assignment - 2025
A project for simulating ecosystem behaviors through genetic algorithm.

One of my biggest projects that I wrote an IDXCA paper, attending a professional presentation, as well as a symposium at school.
This project currently has agents: Rabbit & Foxes, and debugging tools to view percentages of positive and negative genes within the ecosystem.

Please ask me directly for documentation, or further assistance
